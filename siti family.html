            <h2>TOMPOK</h2>
            <p>This is Tompok, my favorite cat, Tompok is also the house's favorite cat.  Tompok is 3 years old, but I only took care of him for 2 years and a half months, because at first this cat was my cousin's cat. He is named Tompok because there is a pattern of spots under his chin.</p>

            <h2>FIRST RABBIT, HELLO PORORO</h2>
            <p>This is my first rabbit, and I named him Pororo. Uncle Amin gave me a rabbit, because almost everyone in my village knows that I am an animal lover. Pororo is also the first rabbit I ever kept, and taking care of rabbits is not as difficult as I thought.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <div class="card-image im-8"></div>
            <h2>NEW RABBIT BABY. WELCOME HOME</h2>
            <p>Again I got rabbits, but this time 3 at once, and I accepted with an open heart. The person who gave is the same person, namely Pacik Amin. He gave me a rabbit because he was no longer fit to take care of rabbits. This rabbit is also from the same parent as Pororo.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">

            <p>But an unfortunate incident happened, where after 2 weeks of me taking care of these rabbits, the brown rabbit named Olet died. Leave the two black ones named TamTam and the black and white one named Nijaboy, including Pororo for me to take care of.</p>
