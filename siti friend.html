            <h2>Since kindergarten</h2>
            <p>This is my two best friends who mean a lot in my life</p>
            <P>1. Nur Farhanesha binti Tanjirullah</P>
            <p>2. Nur Asyirah binti Asil</p>
            <P>We have been good friends since kindergarten. When I was in kindergarten, my family had enough money to build a house, and I lived next door to the two of them, where my house was in the middle between Farha and Syira.</P>

            <h2>POWERPUFF GIRL</h2>
            <p>From Kindergarten to Grade 6 together, we were separated for a while for 3 years because I lived in a dormitory. But that situation did not break our friendship. And our relationship grew closer after I was a class back with them in Form 4 and 5.</p>

            <p>Although they are now far away, Siti at UiTM Puncak Perdana, Farha in Johor and Syirah at UMK, Kelatan, this situation is not a reason for us to break our relationship. Even though we rarely see each other, our bond of friendship remains intact.</p>
